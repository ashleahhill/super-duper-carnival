# super-duper-carnival 

I have a loved one who lives in another country with a very different climate to the one that I live in. When we talk, sometimes subjects such as "It's been really hot here" come up. 

However, I honestly can't tell if 30 degrees Celcius is hot without the help of Google converting the temperature to Farenheit for me. This app will cut out the middle man.
